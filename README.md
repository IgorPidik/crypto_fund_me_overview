# CryptoFundMe
A simple hobby project, designed to help me gain experience with smart contracts and break into the web3 space.

# Components
This project consists of 2 parts:
  1. [Smart contract](https://github.com/IgorPidik/crypto_fund_me_contract) written in Solidity, which stores and manages the projects, created by the users.
  2. [dApp](https://github.com/IgorPidik/crypto_fund_me_dapp) written in React, which handles user interactions such as creating projects, donating and withdrawing donations.
